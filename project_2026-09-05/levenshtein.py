    """
    Calculates the Levenshtein distance between two strings using dynamic programming.
    The Levenshtein distance is a string metric for measuring the difference between
    two sequences. Informally, the Levenshtein distance between two words is the minimum
    number of single-character edits (insertions, deletions, or substitutions) required
    to change one word into the other.

    Args:
        s1 (str): The first string.
        s2 (str): The second string.

    Returns:
        int: The Levenshtein distance between s1 and s2.
